**Flask** is a small and lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features that make creating web applications in Python easier. It gives developers flexibility and is a more accessible framework for new developers since you can build a web application quickly using only a single Python file. Flask is also extensible and doesnâ€™t force a particular directory structure or require complicated boilerplate code before getting started.
